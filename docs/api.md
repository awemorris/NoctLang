API
===

The API is a modular library that allows you to include only the
necessary components in libnoctlang through build options. There are
no mandatory APIs â€” developers are free to choose which ones to
integrate into their applications. The `noct` command includes all
APIs except those related to the GUI, while the `gnoct` command
includes all APIs, including the GUI ones.
