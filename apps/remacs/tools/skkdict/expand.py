# expand.py - Build the remacs SKK dictionary (SKK-JISYO.remacs) from
# hand-authored, clean-room source lists.
#
# The linguistic content (readings, kanji, conjugation class) is authored
# by hand in src/*.tsv.  This script only performs the *mechanical* string
# work of turning that content into SKK dictionary format:
#   - merging okuri-nasi candidates that share a reading,
#   - deriving okuri-ari headwords (reading-stem + okurigana consonant)
#     from a word's conjugation class,
#   - sorting and emitting the two SKK sections in UTF-8.
#
# No entry is copied from any existing dictionary (SKK-JISYO.L is GPL and
# is never read); the readings are original.  Therefore the output carries
# only the remacs license, with no third-party attribution requirement.
#
# Source format (TAB-separated), '#' starts a comment line:
#   nouns/misc :  reading <TAB> kanji[,kanji2,...] [<TAB> annotation]
#   verb godan :  V5 <TAB> reading(dict-form) <TAB> kanji-stem
#   verb ichidan: V1 <TAB> reading(dict-form) <TAB> kanji-stem <TAB> stem-reading
#   adjective   :  ADJ <TAB> reading(dict-form ...i) <TAB> kanji-stem <TAB> stem-reading
#
# The verb/adjective rows carry the *reading* only; the kanji stem is the
# part shown before the okurigana.  Godan derives the stem reading by
# dropping the last kana; ichidan/adjective give it explicitly because the
# okurigana length varies (見る=み+る vs 食べる=た+べる).
